            Advancements in information technology is leading the world altogether away from the traditional
            way of living to a new way of living that is heavily integrated with technology. The increased
            standard of living today has led to the pursuit of automated and convenient control systems.
            Automated systems will help people make their lives easier by taking care of the trivial tasks, leaving
            them to spend more time on the complicated tasks that require more resources. An example of this is that
            we were able to automate the lights of a room to switch off if there is no motion. This is the primary
            focus of our project. Systems like these will be extremely helpful for conserving power in big
            institutions. Most of the existing, well-established automation systems are based on wired
            communication. <br><br>
            Todayâ€™s technology gives us the capability to accomplish tasks at an accelerated pace. Thanks to the
            capability of computers and the Internet, we have access to enormous amounts of information with
            the click of a button. Technology has also given us the ability to organize our time and communicate
            with others with ease. The communication between devices can provide control of the devices to user.
